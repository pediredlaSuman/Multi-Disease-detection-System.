1. Employed training, testing, validation, and k-fold validation methodologies on the main dataset.
2. Applied ML techniques, including SVM, LR, CNN, and KNN, for diagnosing Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.
3. Utilized k-fold cross-validation and Platt Scaling to enhance accuracy in disease prediction.
4. Enhanced accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and visualized confusion matrix graphs for disease diagnosis.
   
Results:Achieved high accuracy and reliability in disease detection.and Developed a website and mobile application for the Detection System.
   
Contributions:Improved model precision, accuracy, and sensitivity significantly.Implemented a robust web-based diagnostic system.Utilized metrics like sensitivity, accuracy, reliability, recall, precision, and confusion matrices.

Benefits of Real-Time Implementation:
  - Early Intervention:Enables timely detection and intervention in health issues.
  - Continuous Monitoring: Offers real-time health parameter tracking for proactive care.
  - User-Friendly:Easy accessibility through web and mobile interfaces.
  - Versatility:Adaptable to various diseases and medical scenarios.
  - Scalability:Cloud deployment for handling a large user base.
