# Multi Disease Detection System

## Description
This project utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to create a multi-disease detection system for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's. The system aims to enhance early diagnosis and patient care through a user-friendly web application, improving healthcare accessibility and efficiency.

## Proposed Framework
1. **Data Import and Standardization:** Use libraries and standardize data using a Standard Scaler.
2. **Model Training:** Train models using SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, and CNN.
3. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score.

### Proposed System Images

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression applies a sigmoid function to estimate probabilities and classify data.

## Benefits of Real-Time Implementation
- **Early Intervention:** Enables timely detection and intervention in health issues.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Offers real-time health parameter tracking for proactive care.
- **User-Friendly:** Easy accessibility through web and mobile interfaces.
- **Versatility:** Adaptable to various diseases and medical scenarios.
- **Scalability:** Cloud deployment for handling a large user base.

## Results
The multi-disease detection system demonstrates effective classification and diagnosis of diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's. The results showcase the model's performance through various metrics.
